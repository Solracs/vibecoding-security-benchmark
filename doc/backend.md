# Backend

The following languages are being considered:
 * PHP
 * Python
 * Javascript (NodeJS)

## Real-world use:

 * PHP:     ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
 * Python:  ⭐️⭐️
 * NodeJS:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Based on research, PHP is still the backbone of around 70–80% of web servers. It has a solid background in the industry, has been used for a long time, and is still widely used today.

Python is most of the time recommended for small projects and is quite popular for beginners. However, it is not as commonly used for large-scale web solutions compared to the other alternatives.

NodeJS has a large community, strong support, and is used in major projects. Many companies use it for modern web applications.

## Easy to code/read/maintain:

 * PHP:     ⭐️⭐️⭐️
 * Python:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
 * NodeJS:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
 
PHP has a lot of documentation, but if no framework is used, it can be harder to maintain compared to the other alternatives.

Even though Python is not focused exclusively on web app backends, it has great libraries that make this development really easy and quick to set up.

NodeJS has many frameworks and tools that simplify backend development, making it relatively easy to build and maintain scalable web applications.

## "Hacker-Friendly"

 * PHP:     ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
 * Python:  ⭐️⭐️
 * NodeJS:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

PHP might be the preferred backend for Hackers. It has a lot of functions that might cause vulnerabilities if they are not implemented and limited correctly. There are a lot of examples out there in forums that are not secure. A lot of web audits/Writeups of PHP applications can be found online.

Python includes character escaping by default with Flask and Django, which adds an extra layer of security. Apart from that, mistakes can be done and vulnerabilities will be possible to include by LLMs.

NodeJS does not provide many security measures by default. So it can be prone to include vulnerabilities. It usually depends on third party libraries for security additions.

## Summary
 
 * PHP      12/15⭐️
 * Python    9/15⭐️
 * NodeJS   13/15⭐️

 Therefore NodeJS will be chosen to be used for the backend. (unless something changes up on professor's review)
